# Contributing to Strapi + Better Auth

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is in early beta, so contributions of all kinds — bug reports, feature ideas, documentation improvements, and code — are especially valuable.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22
- pnpm >= 10

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strapi-community/plugin-better-auth.git
cd plugin-better-auth
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

### Dev commands

All dev commands start the playground Strapi app. Postgres and MySQL variants start the required Docker service automatically.

```bash
pnpm dev                  # SQLite (default)
pnpm dev:postgres         # Postgres
pnpm dev:mysql            # MySQL
```

See [`packages/dev-utils`](./packages/dev-utils/README.md) for details on `dev-strapi` and `with-db`.
